The project, "_Development and Validation of a Method for Determining Benzene in BPO-based Products,_" was conducted with the aim of developing and validating a fast, sensitive, and reliable method for the routine determination of benzene and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. The developed method will enable manufacturers and quality control laboratories to more efficiently monitor products, thereby enhancing safety and compliance with regulatory requirements.

The project was carried out in collaboration with the Faculty of Chemical Engineering and Technology at the University of Zagreb, which provided the expertise and resources necessary for the method's development. The method was based on gas chromatography (GC), and the thermal decomposition of BPO and the formation of benzene, which is characteristic of conventional procedures, was successfully avoided by using a different approach to benzene extraction with hexane. This innovative approach ensured greater reliability and precision of the results.

The project included two key phases: the development and validation of the method, and the commercialization of the developed analytical method to quality control laboratories. This initiative will significantly contribute to improving the safety and quality of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products on the market.

At LabSense, we're committed to staying at the forefront of scientific advancements in the pharmaceutical industry. That's why we recently participated in [BIOCentre â€“ Incubation centre for biosciences's](https://www.linkedin.com/company/biocentre-zagreb/) "Characterization of Biological Drugs" event, held on May 21st, 2024.

The event covered a wide range of topics, delving into the process of creating and characterizing protein-based drugs, all the way to cell therapies. We gained valuable insights into protein construction, production, and purification, the importance of glycosylation, formulation strategies, regulatory considerations, advanced characterization techniques, solutions for oligonucleotide therapeutics, and cellular therapies.

By attending events like this, our team stays current on the latest trends and technologies, allowing us to better serve our clients and contribute to the progress of the pharmaceutical industry.

This week, the LabSense team had an incredibly productive visit to #ACHEMA2024, the leading international trade fair for the process industries. We explored the latest advancements in laboratory technology, analytical instruments, and process technology, connected with industry experts, exchanged ideas, and established new partnerships. Attending inspiring lectures and workshops provided us with valuable insights into future trends.

With exhibitors from over 50 countries, ACHEMA is the driving force for the international process industries. We delved into lab, pharma, process, green, and digital innovation, expanding our knowledge and staying current with newest trends.


Based on our insights from Achema 2024, we're leveraging new technologies and refining our laboratory processes. Our aim is not only to enhance our own capabilities but also to empower our clients in the pharma & biotech industries. We are committed to offering innovative end-to-end solutions that help them gain a competitive edge.

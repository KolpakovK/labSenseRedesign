We are excited to share our experience at the "𝐂𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐬" event, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Human Technology Styria cluster. As new members of the cluster, we had the opportunity to participate in this relaxed and inspiring atmosphere on June 27th, 2024, which allowed us to connect with other members and explore potential future collaborations.

Events like these are incredibly important as they help us achieve common goals and contribute to the improvement of the community. We thank the organizers, [Human.technology Styria GmbH](https://www.linkedin.com/company/humantechnologystyria/), for this exceptional opportunity and look forward to future collaborations.

On June 5th, we had the pleasure of attending the first Morning Health Talks (MHT) of 2024. Organized by EIT Health Hub for Croatia, this gathering brought together key healthcare stakeholders to discuss "Open Innovation in Healthcare - Challenges and Opportunities".

The event opened with welcoming remarks, followed by insightful presentations on establishing open innovation systems at the Universities of Zagreb and Graz and developing innovative healthcare products. Speakers showcased how professional teams and strong partnerships drive healthcare innovations. The panel discussion covered challenges and opportunities in open innovation, the role of startups, and the importance of collaboration between healthcare institutions and tech companies. The positive energy and exchange of ideas highlighted the need for ongoing dialogue and cooperation.

We are grateful to [Vesna Gabelica Markovic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vesna-gabelica-markovic-1170b322/) for recognizing LabSense as a contributor to healthcare innovation and inviting us to this inspiring event. We look forward to continuing the conversation on healthcare innovation.

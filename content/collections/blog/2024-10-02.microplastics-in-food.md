In recent times, there has been a growing concern regarding the pervasive presence of microplastics in marine life, drinking water, and various food sources. The consumption of these microscopic particles has the potential to disrupt critical biological processes in the human body, affecting the endocrine and immune systems, mobility, reproduction, development, and potentially leading to carcinogenesis. Addressing this pressing issue requires a collaborative effort from scientists, regulators, industries, and consumers to formulate effective strategies and solutions. 

 

At LabSense, our commitment to addressing this global challenge is underscored by a focus on automation and the integration of sample preparation with the Infrared/Raman Microscope. This innovative approach stands out as a distinctive solution in the market, offering precise microplastic analysis.
